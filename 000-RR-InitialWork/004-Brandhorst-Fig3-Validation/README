This study tries to replicate the results from Figure 3 of the Brandhorst paper. This is effectively a repeat of the
analysis from study 003-Brandhorst-Fig-2-Validation, but varying the perigee angle.

NOTES:
- access_time_analysis.py is an initial attempt.
- replicate_brandhorst_fig_3.py is a version using generic_functions.py and seems to give better results, though they
  conflict with those in the original paper.

DATA FILES:
{degree}-sat-illumination-times.csv gives the times when the satellite is illuminated by the sun.
{degree}-degrees.csv gives the access times to the target.
illumination-times.csv gives the times when the target is illuminated by the sun.
