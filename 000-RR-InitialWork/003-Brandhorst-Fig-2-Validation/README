This more advanced study attempts to validate the Brandhorst paper Figure 2 results. The solar illumination needs to be
taken into account as well. To replicate these results, the overlap between events needs to be determined, filtering out
access times when the target is illuminated by the sun.

NOTES:
- access_parsing_script.py is a first attempt to replicate the results.
- compute_access_to_target.py is an improved version, making use of generic_functions.py to simplify code

DATA FILES:
Brandhorst_Sim_1_High_Res.csv - contains access times between satellite and target.
Target IlluminationTimes.csv - contains times when target is illuminated by the sun.
Satellite IlluminationTimes.csv - contains times when satellite is illuminated by the sun.
